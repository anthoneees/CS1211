# Image-Editor
This project was made in my Object Oriented Programming class
It is an image editor that edits both .ppm and .pgm files by converting the binary values in the file itself
There are 4 methods that can be run:
Rotate - which needs either a counterclockwise or clockwise argument 
Scale - which needs a number argument so it knows how much to scale by
Flip - which needs either a veritcal or horizontal argument after it 
Crop - which needs 4 arguments(the top Y coordinate you would like to crop at, the top X coordinate you would like to type at, the height of the image, and the width of the image)
Code is written 100% in Java and is accessed by the ImagingApp class
